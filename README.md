# Project: Truth or Bluff.

# Aim: We have a dataset of 10 designation with the Experience & Salary we train our model so that it can check whether the salary requested by employees are True or bluff.

# Steps:
  - Importing the libraries.
  - Importing the dataset.
  - Training the Linear Regression model on the whole dataset.
  - Training the Polynomial Regression model on the whole dataset.
  - Visualising the Linear Regression results.
  - Visualising the Polynomial Regression results.
  - Visualising the Polynomial Regression results (for higher resolution and smoother curve).
  - Predicting a new result with Linear Regression.
  - Predicting a new result with Polynomial Regression.
